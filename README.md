## Overview

The SeamCarver project is a powerful image processing tool that utilizes algorithm design to identify and remove less "interesting" paths in a picture. By comparing colors, the project identifies and eliminates these paths, resulting in an image with less "fluff". This process is commonly referred to as image seam carving.
### Features

Seam Carving: Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique. It automatically removes less important parts of the image to resize it without distortion.
Color Comparison: The project uses advanced color comparison algorithms to identify less "interesting" paths in the image.
Fluff Removal: SeamCarver helps in removing unnecessary details or "fluff" from the image, making it more focused and visually appealing.
### How it Works

Color Analysis: The project analyzes the colors in the image, assigning importance scores to each pixel based on color intensity, contrast, or other factors.
Seam Identification: Using dynamic programming or other suitable algorithms, the project identifies the least important seams (paths) in the image.
Seam Removal: The identified seams are removed from the image, effectively reducing its size without losing important visual content.
Result: The output is a refactored image with reduced "fluff" and preserved essential features.
